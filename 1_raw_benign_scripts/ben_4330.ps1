Unlock every Power Plan and corresponding option on Windows. Just paste in an elevated PowerShell.

Use this instead of some shady PowerCfg commands or .reg file as this script works even for newer/unknown settings: It will look up the PowerSettings registry hive and just add or change a value (Attributes = 2) on the corresponding option to reveal it.

The OneLiner version is untested but should also work...

Requirements:
- Windows 7 - 10
- Elevated PowerShell v2 - v7
