.Synopsis
    Copies, imports, executes Get-InjectedThread, then deletes the full Stop-Thread.ps1 script.

.DESCRIPTION
    Uses WINRM to create remote sessions to hosts. Stop-Thread.ps1 is copied across to the remote hosts.
    It is then imported to the session. The function Stop-Thread is executed on the remote machine and
    results displayed on your host. The Stop-Thread.ps1 script is then removed from the remote machine
    to prevent tampering.

.PARAMETER ThreadID
    Required
    The ThreadID of the Thread you wish to stop.
                              
.EXAMPLE
    .\Stop_Remote_Thread.ps1 -ThreadID 1234 -RemoteHost 192.168.1.1

.INPUTS
    Stop-Thread.ps1 is required to be in the same path as this script.
    You will be prompted for a username and password for the remote hosts.
    A text file containing one IP address per line for each hosts you want to deploy the forwarder to will be required.
