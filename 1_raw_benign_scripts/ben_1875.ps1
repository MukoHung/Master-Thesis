.Synopsis
   Parses html files produced by Google Takeout to present Google Voice call and text history in a useful way.
.DESCRIPTION 
   When exporting Google Voice data using the Google Takeout service, the data is delivered in the form
   of many individual .html files, one for each call (placed, received, or missed), each text message 
   conversation, and each voicemail or recorded call. For heavy users of Google Voice, this could mean many
   thousands of individual files, all located in a single directory.  This script parses all of the html 
   files to collect details of each call or message and outputs them as an object which can then be 
   manipulated further within powershell or exported to a file.  
   
   This script requires the "HTML Agility Pack", available via NuGet.  The script was written and tested
   with HTML Agility Pack version 1.4.9 For more information, go to http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/
   
   In order to run this script, you must have at least powershell version 3.0.  If you're running Windows 7,
   You can update powershell by installing the latest "Windows Management Framework" from microsoft, currently
   WMF 4.

.EXAMPLE
   import-gvhistory -path c:\temp\takeout\voice\calls -agilitypath C:\packages\HtmlAgilityPack.1.4.9\lib\net45
   
   This command parses files in c:\temp\takeout\voice\calls using the HtmlAgilityPack.dll file located 
   in 'C:\packages\HtmlAgilityPack.1.4.9\lib\net45'.  Run this way, all of the text message and call history would be
   output to the screen only.
   
.EXAMPLE
   import-gvhistory -path c:\temp\takeout\voice\calls -agilitypath C:\packages\HtmlAgilityPack.1.4.9\lib\net45\ |
        where-object {$_.Type -eq "Text"} | export-csv c:\temp\TextMessages.csv
        
    This command uses the same parameters as Example 1, but then passes the information on be filtered 
    by Where-Object to only include records of Text messages, and not calls.  After filtering, the information
    is saved to c:\temp\TextMessages.csv by passing the output of Where-Object to Export-CSV.  
.EXAMPLE
   import-gvhistory -path c:\temp\takeout\voice\calls | export-csv c:\temp\GVHistory.csv
    This command does not include the -agilitypath parameter, so the script will attempt to find 
    and use HTMLAgilityPack.dll in the current working directory. The command will process all call and text
    message information and save it to c:\temp\GVHistory.csv
