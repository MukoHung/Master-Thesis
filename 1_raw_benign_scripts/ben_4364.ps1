<#
A PowerShell workflow to download Sysinternals tools from web to a local folder.

Last updated: February 15, 2016
version     : 2.1

Changelog:
 2.0
 Moved path validation to a sequence step
 If destination doesn't exist it will be created.
 Modified activities to make them compatible with PowerShell 3.0
 Added error handling for starting the Webclient service
 Tested and verified remote processing
 combined a few sequences to avoid scoping problems
 Added code to download a list of online files and then compare instead of trying to 
 get each file online individually and then compare.
 Tested remote installation
 Modified version requirement to v4 since I have no v3 clients left to test with
 
 2.1
 Added detailed progress information
 Added Passthru parameter and changed default behavior to not display files as they are copied
